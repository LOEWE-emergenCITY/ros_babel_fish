  * Fixes to compile on Rolling.
  ROS 2 Rolling has made two changes that cause this package
  to not build in its current form:
  1. The TRACEPOINT macro has been renamed to TRACETOOLS_TRACEPOINT.
  2. The action_tutorials_interface package has been removed,
  since it was duplicating an action that was already available
  in example_interfaces.
  This commit fixes both of these issues.
